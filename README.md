# Sharvin Soham – Quantum AI Portfolio (with shadcn/ui)

This portfolio is a reflection of my interdisciplinary interests at the intersection of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and astrophysics. From intelligent automation tools to quantum machine learning models, each project represents my pursuit of becoming a researcher, engineer, and future astronaut.

Built using React, TailwindCSS, Vite and shadcn/ui, the design is inspired by the visual aesthetics of quantum fields and deep space — minimal, modular, and cosmic.


## ✨ Features
- Particle starfield background (react-tsparticles)
- Resume PDF preview
- Animated sections with Framer Motion
- UI components from shadcn/ui (Button, Card)
- Fully responsive design
